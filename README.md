# OSX-Mouse-Jiggler
Mouse Jiggler is a simple Python script that simulates mouse clicks on macOS to keep the system active. This can be useful for preventing the computer from going to sleep or locking while you're away from your desk. The script also provides real-time updates on the number of clicks performed and the remaining time until it stops running.
